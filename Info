Import from Web add-on

Install the add-on through google sheets add-ins store.

It works by using the following syntax:

=IMPORTFROMWEB(URL, XPATH, OptionalParameter)

Because in order to import the information we need the URL and Xpath, a way to automize a google search perphaps would be:

URL:

Concatinating the google standard URL with the desired keywords.
We do this by using:

=ARRAYFORMULA()

for our cell 
Google uses 3 parameters: 

q=keyword+key, indicating the request
hl=fr, indicating the language of the results
num=100, the number of results to be returned. By default the value is 10. Using the number 1 provides the
"cleanest" result.

So for example
https://www.google.com/search?q=delve+everything&hl=en&num=100

=ARRAYFORMULA(“https://www.google.com/search?q=”&SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,”+”)&”&hl=en&num=100″)
And we good our link by putting our key words on A1, it can be more or less, but this is the format

once we have to URL in a cell, we can put it as our first parameter on IMPORTFROMWEB()

Now we just need the second (which part of the website do we want?)

XPATH

Then for our XPATH CELL

XPath is a language for describing an element of an XML script. And the good news is that, HTML being derived from XML, XPaths also apply to our beloved web pages.
A simple example: //h1 indicates all the titles of the page, the double slash indicating that the path is relative, so not necessarily a direct child of the document root.
In our case, the XPath will be a little more complex:

//div[@class="g"] indicates all the wrapper elements for each result. That is, all “div” of class “g”
And by adding //h3, we grab the title of each container

So back to our IMPORTFROMWEB function in simple words

=IMPORTFROMWEB(LINK, part of the website, optional parameter)
Because all the parts of the websie are the same base (//div[@class="g"]) we can use it as our optional common paramenter for our XPATH
or "part of the website"

So a great example would be:
A1: KEYWORD (whatever you want to lookup)
B1: =ARRAYFORMULA(“https://www.google.com/search?q=”&SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,”+”)&”&hl=en&num=100″)
A2: baseSelector
B2: //div[@class="g"]
A3: //h3
B3: //h3/../@href
C3: //span[@class="st"]

A6: =IMPORTFROMWEB(A1, A3:C3, A2:B2)

TITLE: A3 code
LINK SOURCE: B3 code
DESCRIPTION: C3 code

To help you write your XPaths, install XPath Helper for Chrome
(it's a extension to see what you are grabbing from a website)


If you see #PENDING_REQUESTS, open the add-on sidebar through the menu: Add-ons > IMPORTFROMWEB > Open sidebar, then push the “Actions” button at the bottom and finally click on “Refresh pending requests”
